            This variation explores the general comparison between males and females
            of different age groups between the years 1979 and 2015. It shows a rising or falling
            trend which views can see and explore. It also shows the maximum and minimum value so a
            viewer can do research as to what event during that year may have caused it. We can also
            see that aside from the children, Males suicide rates are much higher than Females
            suicide rates. I thought about getting rid of the background grid and keeping it as simple
            as possible, but that makes it harder for the viewer to read the data.

            <br>
            This variation shows the same type of data as previous variation, but the difference is in
            the use of icons. I wanted to get a little creative and so this data uses a skull icon which
            signifies death. It is still able to tell the trend and now we can compare individual points
            easily. The color is used to signify the age group just as before.

            This variation was created to see the data from an alternative point of view. In this
            visualization we have Nominal data sex being represented by colors, as opposed to the ordinal
            data (Age range) and we have different column for different age groups. The colors are bright
            and easily distinguishable, allowing the viewer to quickly see all the blues (or all the reds)
            and compare them against each other, or compare the blue with red in each column. This data also
            shows the maximum and minimum for each gender which makes it easier to quickly tell the difference.
